## Introduction

In [Part 5](/docs/tutorial/part-5/), you added all of your blog posts to your Blog page. But that means that your Blog page will get longer and longer as you add more posts to your site. It would be better if each post lived on its own page, and then your Blog page could link out to all the different posts.

So far, the way you've created new pages for your Gatsby site is by creating a new file in the `src/pages` directory and hard-coding the page's contents in JSX. But manually creating a new page for each post would be quite repetitive, especially since each page has the same structure: render the frontmatter and contents of an MDX file.

In this part of the Tutorial, you'll learn how to create new pages dynamically using Gatsby's Filesystem Route API.

By the end of this part of the Tutorial, you will be able to:

- Use Gatsby's Filesystem Route API to dynamically create new pages for your blog posts.
- Add a query variable to a page query.

## Summary

Take a moment to think back on what you've learned so far. Challenge yourself to answer the following questions from memory:

* What is the File System Route API used for?
* What is the syntax for creating a new collection route?
* What is a query variable?
* When can you use a query variable?

**Ship It!** ðŸš€

Before you move on, deploy your changes to your live site on Gatsby Cloud so that you can share your progress!

First, run the following commands in a terminal to push your changes to your GitHub repository. (Make sure you're in the top-level directory for your Gatsby site!)

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Finished Gatsby Tutorial Part 6"
git push
```

Once your changes have been pushed to GitHub, Gatsby Cloud should notice the update and rebuild and deploy the latest version of your site. (It may take a few minutes for your changes to be reflected on the live site. Watch your build's progress from your [Gatsby Cloud dashboard](/dashboard/).)

### Key takeaways

* Gatsby's File System Route API lets you dynamically create new pages from data layer nodes by naming your files with a special syntax.
    * File System Routes only work on files in the `src/pages` directory (or subdirectories).
    * To create a new collection route, you name your file `{nodeType.field}.js`, where `nodeType` is the type of node you want to create pages from, and `field` is the data field from that node type that you want to use in the URL for that page.
* Query variables let you pass in different data values to the same GraphQL query. They can be combined with field arguments to get back data only about a specific node.
* Query variables can only be used in page queries.

### What's coming next?

In Part 7, you'll revisit `gatsby-plugin-image` (from way back in [Part 3](/docs/tutorial/part-3/)). This time, you'll learn how to create dynamic images using the `GatsbyImage` component. You'll put the finishing touches on your blog site by adding hero images to your blog posts.
